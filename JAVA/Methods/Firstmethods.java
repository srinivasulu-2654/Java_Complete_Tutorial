Access Specifiers:

1) Public : can be access through any classs in any package
2) Private : can be access by methods in the same class
3) protected
Can be accessed within the same package
+ also by subclasses (child classes) in other packages.

Mostly used when you want limited sharing with inheritance

4) Default (no modifier)
If you donâ€™t write any access modifier, it's considered default (a.k.a. package-private).

Accessible only within the same package.

Not visible in other packages, even subclasses.
