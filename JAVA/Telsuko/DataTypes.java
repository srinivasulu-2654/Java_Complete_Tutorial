/*
 
   Datatypes are primitive and non-primitive
   
    for char -> 2 bytes it will take in java 
    
     Literals - Literals in Java are fixed values that are directly written in the code to represent constant values of primitive data types or strings.

    Casting -> type casting the varibales of data types

    byte b = 127;
    int a = 28;

    b = a; shows wrong(x) because 1 is byte and other is integer

    b = (byte)a
