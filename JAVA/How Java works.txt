please explore this very clearly :

JVM - Java virtual machine :

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a part of Java that runs Java programs.
It reads the compiled Java code (called bytecode) and helps it run on any computer.
It makes Java programs work the same on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

On top of the process it contains like this :

Hardware -> means desktop, laptop or mobile phone

           |

Operating system for the particular device 

           |

JRE -> Java Runtime Environment

           |

JVM -> Java Virtual Machine



Java is platform independent language because it can run in any system of containing any Operating system (windows , linux, MAC etc)

Human writes code -> java code -> converts through compiler (javac) into -> Byte code -> goes on JVM and it will run


if we want to run java code in your friend system then no need to install JDK -> so java is WORA (Write Once and Run anywhere) 

JVM is not a physical machine it is a abstract machine
