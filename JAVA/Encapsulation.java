| ✅ Data hiding         | Prevents outside classes from changing internal state directly           |
| ✅ Control over data   | You can add **validation** inside setters (e.g., age can’t be negative)  |
| ✅ Code maintenance    | Easier to change internal implementation without affecting other classes |
| ✅ Increased security  | Keeps sensitive data protected                                           |
| ✅ Better organization | Keeps related data and methods together in one class                     |
