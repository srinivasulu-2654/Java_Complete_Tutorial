JVM is not a physical machine it is a abstract machine

Java program -> compiler -> bytecode -> JVM -> Machine code -> CPU -> Output

Java program is (.java)
Bytecode is (.class)

Think of writing Java code like writing a recipe:

JDK is the full kitchen (write + cook).

javac is the chef that turns recipe → raw dish (bytecode).

JVM is the stove that cooks it into edible food (machine code).

The CPU serves it.

You enjoy the output!



| Step                      | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Java Source Code**   | You write your program in `.java` file. Example: `Hello.java`          |
| **2. Compiler (`javac`)** | Converts `.java` file → `.class` file (bytecode)                       |
| **3. Bytecode**           | Intermediate code, **platform-independent**, runs on any OS with JVM   |
| **4. JVM**                | Converts bytecode to machine-specific code (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) |
| **5. Machine Code**       | The final instructions CPU understands                                 |
| **6. Output**             | The result of your code, printed to console or GUI                     |


Here JVM - platform dependent and java program - platform independent

for Example mac , windows, linux each have particular OS

JVM understands bytecode
