/*  Here the question is:

Q) Why only 1 public class in java file?

ANS: 1) main method should inside the public class
     2) public class name should be same as file name

Actually here JVM access the main method and program will start and also if there is static then it should be public class so that it could create the object 

Q) Why should be the class name and file name should be the same ?
