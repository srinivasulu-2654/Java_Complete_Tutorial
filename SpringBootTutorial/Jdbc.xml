-> Application <-> JDBC <-> DataBase(Mysql,postgres)
-> JDBC is a java API (set of interfaces and classes) that allows java applications to connect and interact with relational databases in a        standard way

-> It acts as a bridge between code and database

Steps to connect the JDBC:

1. import the packages
2. Load Drivers
3. Register Driver
4. Create Connection
5. Create Statement
6. Execute Statement
7. Close

-> Above steps are like You want to map JDBC steps into a real-life example (you calling your office from home)

1. You take your mobile phone in hand.
2. You insert SIM card into the phone.
3.Your SIM card now registers with the telecom network (tower).
4.You dial your office landline number from mobile.
5. You prepare what to say on the call (e.g., “Hello, can you tell me the meeting update?”).
6. ➡️ You ask the question:
7. ➡️ After getting the info, you say bye and cut the call.


Summary :

1. Import Packages   → Take phone
2. Load Driver       → Insert SIM
3. Register Driver   → SIM connects to network
4. Create Connection → Dial office number
5. Create Statement  → Decide what to ask
6. Execute Statement → Ask question
7. Close             → End call


So here comes to practically :

-> First in intellij open and create project like java language
-> Now it have only java jdk external libraries but we want extra databases libraries also
-> So now we have to go to google and search for postgres drivers for JDBC
-> Or else download from maven repository
