<!-- From Here will start spring boot notes -->

1. Learning about the Maven Section - 4  ************************* Maven

| Concept            | Why You Need It                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `pom.xml`          | To manage dependencies and project info |
| Lifecycle Commands | To build and run projects               |
| Project Structure  | To organize your backend app            |
| Dependencies       | To plug in Spring Boot features         |

Maven is a build automation and dependency management tool.

It‚Äôs used to build, compile, package, and manage dependencies for Java-based projects.

Almost all Spring Boot projects use Maven (or Gradle).

<!-- So Explore about the Jar files which were oudated but just explore these once for knowing purpose -->

If we use maven then if we give our project to our collegue without any conflicts maven will ready to run all the java code irrespective of dependencies

Maven provides Archetypes

üß± What is a Maven Archetype?
üëâ A Maven archetype is like a project template generator.

It helps you quickly generate a new Maven project with a predefined folder structure, files, and configuration.

So here if we want to use old version like downloading jar files or without using Maven then we have to maintain everything like dependencies version like that otherwise it wont work

If we want to connect with Mysql connector then go to "Mvn Repositories" then download Mysql connector this is old method but there are some maven dependencies so we can copy and just paste in (Project Object Model)pom.xml files that's it

Everytime there will GAV in pom.xml 

<groupId>org.example</groupId>
<artifactId>MavenDemo</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

Like above same also will be there mvn repositories 

-> so after adding from mvn repositories there will be one download in dependencies which is known as "Transitive Dependency"

| Term                  | Meaning                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct Dependency     | The dependency you added in your POM file                |
| Transitive Dependency | The dependencies that came **because of** the direct one |

We added this :

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
  <version>9.2.0</version>
</dependency>

üëâ But you also see: (It came automatically)

com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:4.29.0 called -> "Transitive Dependency"

-> If we want to give our project to others then no need to send jar files we can direclty send pom.xml file that's it

-> there is called effective pom which by default add some features

A "Maven Archetype" is like a template/project generator that helps you create a ready-made project structure with:

Standard folders (src/main/java, src/test/java, etc.)

Predefined pom.xml

Sample files (like App.java and AppTest.java)

-> How maven works behind the scene just explore this

C:\Users\<yourname>\.m2\repository



2. Spring Getting Started Section - 7 *************** Spring Theory

spring works with POJO

üß† Spring is a Java framework that helps you build enterprise-level applications ‚Äî like web apps, APIs, desktop apps, etc.

| Term                 | What It Means                        | Analogy                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Spring**           | General Java framework               | Like a car engine                       |
| **Spring Framework** | The full manual configuration setup  | A raw engine that needs assembling      |
| **Spring Boot**      | Simplified, modern version of Spring | A Tesla ‚Äî ready to drive with one click |


Spring is the parent,
Spring Framework is the raw toolbox,
Spring Boot is the smart assistant that configures and runs everything for you.

| Feature           | Spring Framework           | Spring Boot                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Configuration     | Manual (XML, Java-based)   | Automatic (auto-config)              |
| Server setup      | You set up server manually | Embedded server (Tomcat/Jetty)       |
| Complexity        | High                       | Low (Developer-friendly)             |
| Development speed | Slower                     | Much faster                          |
| Use case          | Old-style apps             | Modern web APIs, Microservices, etc. |


IOC & DI

IOC -> Inversion of Control
DI -> Dependency Injection
-> IOC Container

-> Here as a programmer your main concentraion should be on "Business Logic" not on "Objection creation"
-> Spring creates objects for and should store in IOC Container
-> IOC is a principle to follow to achieve this (IOC COntainer) but exactly how it works that's name is called "Dependency Injection"
-> IOC is the principle and DI is the design pattern

‚öôÔ∏è What's the IOC Container?
It‚Äôs the Spring engine that:

Creates objects (beans)

Manages them (singleton, prototype)

Injects them when required

Destroys them when app shuts down

It‚Äôs like a powerful object manager.


| Step | What Happens                                                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | Spring scans your classes for `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc. |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | It creates objects (beans) and stores them in the **IoC Container**         |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | Wherever you write `@Autowired`, it injects the required bean automatically |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | You write business logic, Spring handles object management                  |


| Term              | What It Means                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IoC**           | Principle: Don't create dependencies manually              |
| **DI**            | Design Pattern to inject dependencies                      |
| **IoC Container** | Spring's internal manager that holds and injects all beans |

-> Spring is a framework on top of it there is came into picture called Spring boot
-> Spring 6 and spring boot 3

-> To create the project u have to go to the site called 
<!-- start.spring.io --> 
<!-- https://start.spring.io/ -->

-> For that above site we can directly add in pom.xml also but start.spring.io but this site will give direclty all the things automatically

-> Spring is responsible to create objects called as "beans"

-> IN JVM there will be container where objects will be there like obj1, obj2, obj3

<!-- package com.Sreenu.app;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootDemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(SpringBootDemoApplication.class);

		Alien obj = context.getBean(Alien.class);
		obj.compile();
	}

} -->

So actually above is the main code 

-> If before that we have to mention like @Component on above the Alien class otherwise will give error

üîÅ Full Working Flow in Your Example:
App starts via SpringBootDemoApplication.main().

Spring scans packages and finds @Component on Alien.

Spring creates Alien object and puts it in ApplicationContext (IOC container).

You ask for it: context.getBean(Alien.class)

You call method: obj.compile() ‚Üí prints "Code compiled..."

<!-- Alien obj1 = context.getBean(Alien.class);
obj1.compile(); -->

-> So the above how many times u created the object that many times object will create

-> What if Alien class depends upon another class let's see this also 

-> So we have to use @Autowired annotation check below

<!-- package com.Sreenu.app;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Alien {

    @Autowired
    Laptop laptop;

    public  void code()
    {
        laptop.compile();
    }

} -->

@SpringBootApplication ‚Üí enables component scan
@Component on Alien ‚Üí registers Alien as a bean
@Component on Laptop ‚Üí registers Laptop as a bean
@Autowired in Alien ‚Üí injects Laptop object into Alien
Alien.code() ‚Üí internally calls laptop.compile()


3. Moving to spring boot *********** -> Section - 10

Spring automatically registers this class as a bean named:

"laptop"  (i.e., class name with lowercase first letter)

Even though the class is Laptop, Spring internally does:

beanName = "laptop";


| Injection Type        | Use When                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Field Injection       | Small projects / quick code (not recommended for big apps) |
| Setter Injection      | Dependency is optional or changeable                       |
| Constructor Injection | **Best for required dependencies** (clean, testable)       |

Client -> Server -> DataBase

In Server there are multiple Layers:

Controller | Service | Repository

Controller -> accept the reqest and send the data back
Service -> do any kindd of processing data (Data processing) example. 2 + 3 = 5 , find factorial of 5 like that => Logic 
Repository => actually service wont have data so it will helpful to service to get data from Database
-> Repository also called as "DAO (Data Access Object)"


Actually  @Component and @Service acts as same as both will manage the bean 

<!-- 
@Component       // utility class
public class MyHelper {}

@Service         // service layer
public class UserService {}

@Repository      // repo layer
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Integer> {} -->


4. Spring Boot Web ******  -> Section - 12*******

üî• What is a Servlet?
A Servlet is a Java class used to build web applications. It runs on a server and handles requests from web clients (like browsers), processes them, and sends back a response.

üëâ It is part of Java EE (Jakarta EE) and works on the server-side.

-> Here explore about the Servlet and JSP 

-> Servlet works on backedn and JSP used to show the HTML view pages 
   
   Sentence - 1

-> If student data is stored in the database, when you fetch that data into your application, don't store it in simple variables ‚Äî store it in objects (like Student class). This is part of the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller).

<!-- üìò Explanation:
When we fetch something from the database (like student records), we wrap that data into Java objects instead of using individual variables.

For example:

Student student = new Student(id, name, marks);
This concept is part of Model in MVC, where Model = Java objects that hold the data. -->

Sentence - 2

-> Understand this flow:
User request comes to the Server ‚Üí Server passes it to Controller ‚Üí Controller talks to Model (database) ‚Üí then sends data to the View ‚Üí View shows data to the user.

üìò Explanation:
This is the standard MVC flow.
Let's say the user clicks ‚ÄúView Student Details‚Äù:

Server (Tomcat) receives the request.

Controller (Servlet) processes the request.

Model (POJO + Database) fetches student data.

View (JSP) displays the data back to the user.
 
-> ‚úÖ Corrected Sentence:
In traditional Java web apps:
Controller = Servlet,
Model = POJO classes (Java objects),
View = JSP (JavaServer Pages).

üìò Explanation:
You matched this perfectly üëè
Just a bit of sentence cleanup. This is how MVC maps in Java EE:

| Role       | Java Technology  |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Controller | Servlet          |
| Model      | POJO (Java Bean) |
| View       | JSP              |



‚úÖ Corrected Sentence:
On Tomcat Server, JSP files are automatically converted into Servlets behind the scenes.

üìò Explanation:
This is 100% true.
When you write a .jsp file and run it on Tomcat:

Tomcat internally converts it into a Java class (Servlet).

This Servlet generates HTML and sends it to the browser.

‚úÖ Final Summary for All Your Sentences:

| Your Concept                                   | Clean Version + Explanation       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Store DB data in object, not variables         | ‚úÖ Use POJOs (Model in MVC)        |
| MVC Flow: Server ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí View/Model     | ‚úÖ Correct, just clean the wording |
| Controller = Servlet, Model = POJO, View = JSP | ‚úÖ Absolutely right                |
| JSP is converted into Servlet in Tomcat        | ‚úÖ Perfect & true                  |


‚öôÔ∏è Example Flow (Spring MVC Web App):
üßë User ‚Üí üåê URL ‚Üí üö™ Controller ‚Üí üß† Model (DB) ‚Üí üìÑ View ‚Üí üßë User

‚úÖ Key Components in Spring MVC

| Component      | Annotation                            | Role                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Controller     | `@Controller` or `@RestController`    | Handles web requests       |
| RequestMapping | `@RequestMapping` / `@GetMapping` etc | Maps URL to methods        |
| Model          | POJO + DB (via JPA/Hibernate)         | Stores and fetches data    |
| View           | JSP/HTML/Thymeleaf                    | User sees this             |
| ViewResolver   | Internally configured                 | Decides which page to show |

-> By default spring boot does not support JSP page so for this we have to add one dependency in pom.xml file namely "tomcat jasper"

-> Now it will come this time without downloading because we converted the jsp page into servlet by adding dependencies

-> Just explore about the dispatch servlet also once => to map all the requests

-> Actually  return "result.jsp"; in this also we can pass the result that it can print on screen not on console like result.jsp?add

-> http://localhost:8080/add?num1=88&num2=99 here instead of sending in this url as a parameters there is another things


    <!-- @RequestMapping("add")
    public  String add(HttpServletRequest req, HttpSession session) {
         System.out.println("adding the numbers: ");

         int num1 = Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter("num1"));
         int num2 = Integer.parseInt(req.getParameter("num2"));
         int res = num1 + num2;
         session.setAttribute("result",res);
         System.out.println(res);
         return "result.jsp";
    } -->

=> So above code is outdated code the new code and all will be in Intellij code editor just check in that
=> See actually without sending parameters like this public  String add(int num1, int num2, HttpSession session) also works but instead we can send
   like this na num and num2 then wont work just check with chatgpt
=> By using Requestparam no need to use "HttpServletRequest req"
=> Now i want to remove this in new version "HttpSession session" lets see which will remove this one
=> If u want to transfer between the Controller and jsp we have to use something called as "Model"
=> Instead of "HttpSession session" we are using "Model"
=> for view we have so many options like jsp Thymeleaf liek that
=> FOr example if we want to move .jsp into Thymeleaf then we face difficulties so explore this mava 
=> Threre is something called view ViewResolver
=> Spring boot properties explore what is this
=> we can set properties through "spring application.properties"

=> Actually we are removing this "return.jsp" so instead we have to set like this 

   <!-- spring.mvc.view.prefix = /views/
   spring.mvc.view.suffix = .jsp -->

   in resources folder in that there will be 1 file called application.properties

=> Explore about the "ModelandView"

=> "Model model" instead of this we can use direclty this "ModelandView"

=> Explore more about ModelAttribute also very important

=> "@ModelAttribute" explore this very very very important

=> Here if there is alien and alien1 then use ModelAttribute othere ModelAttribute is completely optional


<!-- package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

	@Autowired
	private Coach coach;

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}

	public void run(String...args)  {
		System.out.println("System getting started...");
		System.out.println(coach.getworkoutdaily());
	}

} -->

=> Here the above code CommandLineRunner we have to implement this because of after running ApplicationContext method then it will come automatically to the next function


************** Important points in Shrayansh Jain udemy Course **********************


=> üìä Data Flow Example (User Fetch)

Client ‚Üí /users/1

Controller ‚Üí calls userService.getUserById(1)

Service ‚Üí applies business logic ‚Üí calls userRepository.findById(1)

Repository ‚Üí fetches User from DB

Service ‚Üí converts User ‚Üí UserDTO

Controller ‚Üí returns JSON response to Client

üëâ So mava, this Layered Architecture makes sure:

Controller = talks to client

Service = brain (business logic)

Repository = talks to database

Entity/DTO/Utility/Config = support system

=> | Feature                | `@Controller`            | `@RestController`           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Purpose                | MVC Web Apps (HTML, JSP) | REST APIs (JSON/XML)        |
| Return Value           | View (page)              | Data (JSON/XML)             |
| Needs `@ResponseBody`? | Yes (for JSON)           | No (built-in)               |
| Common Usage           | Websites, dashboards     | Backend APIs, microservices |


**************Difference b/w @Controller and @RestController ?*****************

-> If we use @Controller we should use @ResponseBody because if we wont give then it wont give JSON format
-> But in @RestController it will give automatically without using @ResponseBody

-> üìå What is @ResponseBody in Spring?
  üëâ @ResponseBody tells Spring "the return value of this method should go directly into the HTTP response body" instead of looking for a view (HTML/JSP page).
    By default, if you use @Controller, Spring assumes you want to return a view name (like JSP/Thymeleaf).
    If you want to return raw data (JSON, XML, String), you must use @ResponseBody.

-> Explore about the @RequestMapping clearly ?

-> Difference b/w @RequestMapping and @GetMapping see below:
| Feature   | `@RequestMapping`                                                 | `@GetMapping`                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Scope     | Generic (any HTTP method)                                         | Specific to GET requests             |
| Verbosity | Verbose (need method param)                                       | Short and clean                      |
| Use case  | When you want a single method to handle **multiple HTTP methods** | When you want to handle **only GET** |

-> so here for the extra logic and all na we have to use "PropertyEditor"

-> Explain about the @PathVariable?
  ‚úÖ Summary:
    @RequestParam ‚Üí extracts values from query parameters (/user?id=10).
    @PathVariable ‚Üí extracts values from path itself (/user/10).

-> How can we create Bean ?
  | Method                                     | When to use                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `@Component`                               | Quick bean creation, default choice     |
| `@Service` / `@Repository` / `@Controller` | Semantic, indicates role                |
| `@Bean` in `@Configuration`                | When you need **custom creation logic** |
| `@Autowired`                               | For **injecting one bean into another** |


-> Here if there is @Component and also parameter constructor then it wont work because it only work for default constructors
   so this time we haave to use @Bean this came into the picture

-> Difference b/w @Component and @Configuration
  | Feature           | `@Component`                                | `@Configuration`                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Usage**         | Marks a class as a bean                     | Marks a class as a config file                                           |
| **Bean creation** | Spring auto-creates the bean from the class | You manually define beans using `@Bean` methods                          |
| **Best for**      | Simple beans (Services, DAO, Controllers)   | Complex beans, third-party beans, or when customization is needed        |
| **Scanning**      | Needs `@ComponentScan` or auto-scan         | Can be loaded directly in `@SpringBootApplication`                       |
| **Example**       | `@Component public class CricketCoach {}`   | `@Configuration public class AppConfig { @Bean CricketCoach coach(){} }` |


-> So here very very very very important thing to understand like if there are multiple beans use @Primary or @Qualifier @


-> Important things are like explore these things DAO, EntityManager, DataSource, JPARepository, CRUDOperations repositories, etc.

-> So actually @Repository is a Spring stereotype annotation that marks a class as a data-access (DAO) component,
   ‚ÄúThis class talks to the database, so treat it as a persistence bean.‚Äù

-> Exception translation (this includes SQLException, PersistenceException)

-> Explore well about the @Transactional part for atleast 1 year of experience candidate

-> Explore these things for sure mava stereotype annotation, data access / persistence layer.

-> | Stereotype    | Purpose                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `@Component`  | Generic Spring bean (any role)         |
| `@Service`    | Business/service logic                 |
| `@Controller` | Web controller (handles HTTP requests) |
| `@Repository` | Data-access / persistence component    |


-> if we use @RestController we dont need to use @ResponseBody it will create automatically

| Annotation          | Used On      | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **@RestController** | Class        | Marks as REST controller, auto `@ResponseBody`. |
| **@RequestMapping** | Class/Method | Map path + method (GET/POST/etc.).              |
| **@GetMapping**     | Method       | Shortcut for `@RequestMapping` with GET.        |
| **@PostMapping**    | Method       | Shortcut for POST.                              |



-> Explore about all the Exceptions like runtime 

   -> Checked Exception 
   -> Unchecked Exception etc


-> In spring boot rest we handled Exception till /300049 like this that means studentId >= thestudents.size();
-> But i didn't handled this thing students/jdkahdajlkh like wrong text like that 

| Status | Meaning                        | Example                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 200    | OK (successful GET/PUT)        | GET /students                   |
| 201    | Created (successful POST)      | POST /students                  |
| 204    | No Content (successful DELETE) | DELETE /students/5              |
| 400    | Bad Request (client error)     | Invalid input data              |
| 404    | Not Found                      | Student with id 5 doesn‚Äôt exist |
| 500    | Internal Server Error          | Something wrong on server side  |


-> So here explore about this like "Clearly explain me about the rest api design"

-> 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a resource / entity?

In REST API, a resource is something in your system that clients want to interact with.

It usually corresponds to a real-world object or a database entity.

Each resource has a unique URL (endpoint) in your API
