=> Then explore about the what is JPA? 
   -> Jakarta Persistence API(JPA) ... previously known as java Persistence API
   -> Standard API for ORM
=> Only a specification

<!-- => Here explore more about the JPA Specs clearly -->

ðŸ”· What Is a JPA Vendor Implementation?
As we said earlier:

JPA is just a specification â†’ interfaces, annotations, and contracts.

To actually run your code (persist entities, execute queries, etc.), you need a JPA provider (i.e., a library/framework that implements those specs).

These are called JPA vendor implementations.

=> Like in JPA and all we can switch to anyone to Hibernate or eclipseLink like that because you are writing code based on JPA
