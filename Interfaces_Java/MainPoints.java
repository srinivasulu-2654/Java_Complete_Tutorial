    Real-Life Analogy:
Interface = Driving License Test → They tell: "If you pass these rules, you can drive."

Class = The actual driver → He/she implements those rules and drives the car.


   🧠 Difference Between Interface vs Class:

   | Feature              | Interface                          | Class                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Type                 | Blueprint/Contract                 | Concrete implementation         |
| Methods              | Only abstract (until Java 8)       | Has full method bodies          |
| Fields               | `public static final` only         | Any type of variable            |
| Inheritance          | Can extend **multiple** interfaces | Can extend **one** class only   |
| Instantiation        | ❌ Can’t create object              | ✅ You can create object         |
| Implements / Extends | Class **implements** interface     | Class **extends** another class |


“An interface is not a class. It is a contract or blueprint.
A class is used to define real behavior, whereas an interface only defines what behavior a class must implement.”


******* Important****

-> so here whatever you implement the abstract class from interface class you can provide all the full methods or else you can still create abstract methods also

-> But coming to the concrete class it should be fully implement all the methods that's it
