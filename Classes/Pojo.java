/*
  POJO - Plain old java object

   Is POJO thread-safe?
â†’ No. If multiple threads access it, you need to handle synchronization manually.

Can POJO have business logic?
â†’ Preferably no. It should just hold data.

POJO vs Entity class?
â†’ Entity class is a POJO + JPA annotations like @Entity, @Id, etc.

POJO with Lombok?
â†’ Using Lombok annotations like @Data, @Getter, @Setter helps auto-generate boilerplate code in POJOs.


 As of now â€” you're just learning Core Java â€” so for now, remember this:
POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is just a simple Java class used to hold data, with:

Private fields

Public getters/setters

Optional constructors, toString(), etc.

No framework, no magic, just plain Java â€” thatâ€™s enough to know at this stage ðŸ’¯
