public class Abstract {
    
}


/*
 
   shows only important features to users and hide its internal implementation

   2 ways to achieve abstraction:

   -> class is declared as abstarct keyword "abstract"
   -> it can have both abstract and non-abstract methods
   -> we cannot create an instance of the class -> that means we cannot create the object of the class 
       => but for this reference can be stored into the parent class check the pdf once
