/*

runnableObj is the work order (task instructions in run() method).

r (Thread) is the worker who will perform that task when started.

 üî∑ üìù Explanation Summary (paste these comments in your notes):
Runnable = What to do (task)

Thread = Who does it (worker)

start() = Creates new thread + runs run() in that thread

run() called directly = Normal method call in main thread (no new thread created)
 
# üßµ Java Multi-Threading: Complete Overview

## ‚úÖ **What is a Thread?**

- A **Thread** is a **unit of execution** within a process.
- It allows **concurrent execution** of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.

---

## üî∑ **Why do we need Threads?**

### üî¥ **Without threads (Single-threaded program):**

- Tasks execute **sequentially** (one after another).
- Example:
  ```java
  downloadFile(); // takes 10 sec
  updateDatabase();
  sendEmail();



  | **Code**                                                             | **Real meaning**                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LearningMultiThreading runnableObj = new LearningMultiThreading();` | Define **what task to perform** (task: print thread name)                  |
| `Thread r = new Thread(runnableObj);`                                | Create a **worker (Thread r)** and give it the task to do                  |
| `r.start();`                                                         | Start the **worker** ‚Äì it runs the **task‚Äôs run() method** in a new thread |
