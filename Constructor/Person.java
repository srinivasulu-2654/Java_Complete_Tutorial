/*
    ðŸ”¥ So the flow is:
Manager() constructor is called.

Inside it, Java automatically calls super() â†’ Person() constructor is executed.

Person() prints: This is person class with no arguments.

Then Manager() prints: This is manager class with no arguments.

âœ… Important Notes:
You didn't write super() â†’ but Java inserted it automatically.

If the parent class has a parameterized constructor, then you must explicitly call super(args) â€” Java won't insert it in that case.
